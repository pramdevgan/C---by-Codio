#include <iostream>

// The switch case statement is a way to make a decision with multiple possible outcomes. 
// Instead of nesting or sequencing many

// Here are the rules for writing a switch case statement:
// Start with switch followed by the variable that is going to be tested in parentheses ().
// All of the cases are surrounded by a set of curly braces {}.
// Each case is followed by a numerical value and a colon :.
// After each :, write the code that should run if the variable is equal to that caseâ€™s value.
// After each section of code per case, include break;.
// As the very last case, use default: to specify what should happen if none of the above cases are true.

    int dayOfWeek;
    cout << "Enter day Number: ";
    cin >> dayOfWeek ; 

    // int dayOfWeek = 3;
